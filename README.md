# Azahar (Shopping Car)
Azahar is the name of a project for an online coffee shop. All of its sales are done virtually, user registrations are managed, and employees work remotely, among other aspects. This project is undertaken as an exercise to learn the fundamentals of SQL.

## Things to consider:
- Since this is a SQL learning practice, there may be errors in the entity-relationship model, which is in Spanish.
- The PHP code provided, along with the entity-relationship model, is in Spanish. It is not fully optimized and contains programming bad practices, so there is room for improvement.
- The records included in the .sql file are entirely fictitious and have been created by the owner of this project.
